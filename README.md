# Lua - LÖVE

> My simple games made with LÖVE

## Getting Started

Download the latest version of LÖVE from [the website](https://love2d.org/#download), and install it. More instructions on the [getting started](https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started) page.

If you are on Linux I recommend downloading the AppImage version, renaming it to `love` and placing it somewhere in your path like `~/.local/share/bin` or `~/bin`. In my case, I also had to install a few OpenGL dependencies by running `sudo apt install libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev`. Then just run `love sokoban` in the root directory to play Sokoban or any other app.
